Mary had a little lamb. 
Its fleece was white as snow. 
And everywhere that Mary went. 
That lamb was sure to go. 

I have zero creativity when it comes to poems, sorry - Alex

This is me after one year almost exactly. 
I really should've been more creative.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
-Robert Frost
